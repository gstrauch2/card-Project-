#Egyptian Rat Screw
I am going to chose to make the card game Egyptian rat screw. This game seems fairly simple and depends on user input rather than the cards that you are dealt such as in war. This game also has certain  conditions where you ‘slap’ the cards and the first person to slap gets the deck of played cards such as when same value cards are played back to back, this can be accomplished with a key on both ends of the keyboard that go into the command line as a slap button for each player.
